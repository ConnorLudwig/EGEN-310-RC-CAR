# EGEN-310-RC-CAR
Code for control app for EGEN310, group B.5


Arduino code should be uploaded to a arduino uno. Need a bluetooth reciever conencted to the arduino running bluetooth version 
4.0 or newer. 

Controller ap is written in processing. Processing is built on a java framework that provides high level drawing and 
visual functions. Processing must be downloaded in order for the code to run correctly. 

Make sure the bluetooth reciever is conencted to the device that will be running the processing code.

*********************************************** Important Note ****************************************************************

This code was written specifically for the car we designed. To use this code on any other RC you will need to modify things 
such as what pin is activated once a specific serial code is recieved. But it should give you a good starting point.
